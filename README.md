ISS Tracking Notification System

This Python program tracks the International Space Station (ISS) and sends an email notification if the ISS is overhead during sunset or sunrise hours. It uses the Sunrise-Sunset API to get the current sunrise and sunset times for a specified latitude and longitude. The program then checks if the ISS is overhead within a certain range of coordinates and if the current time is during sunset or sunrise. If both conditions are met, it sends an email notification using the Gmail SMTP server.

Setup
Replace MY_LAT and MY_LONG with your latitude and longitude.
Replace EMAIL and PASSWORD with your Gmail email and password or the one generated by Gmail for app use, as Gmail might not allow the script to access it and send the email for security reasons.

Package dependencies:
- requests
- smtplib
- time
- keyboard
